# Considerations for Decision Making in Bayesian Response Adaptive Randomized Trials with Sample Size Re-estimation

This code accompanies "Considerations for Decision Making in Bayesian Response Adaptive Randomized Trials with Sample Size Re-estimation" by Aslanyan et. al. 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo into your desired directory 

```
git clone git@github.com:vahanaslanyan/ssr_rar_interim_decision.git
```
## Tables

Execute `bayesian_sse_rar.R`. This will create 4 dataframes with necessary data.

## Figures

Execute `plots.R`. This will create the two figures from the paper.

## Real life example reanalyses

Execute `graduate_sims.R`. This will create the dataframes similar to the ones needed for Tables 1-8.
